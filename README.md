# The naming of Mo's bike

## Introduction
Mo gave me the prestigious task of naming his new motorbike. I decided to come up with a shortlist of three names and let Mo choose which one he prefered. 
I coded this local website to present the shortlisted names and give him an easy way to browse through them a few times before deciding on one.

### Purpose of the website

1. Present three alternative names to Mo
2. Practice using JavaScript to make a website interactive
